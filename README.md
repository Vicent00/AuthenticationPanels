# Advanced Authentication Panel with Next.js

This project implements a sophisticated authentication system with multiple security layers, designed to provide a robust and secure user authentication experience. It serves as a comprehensive example of modern authentication best practices and security implementations.

## Key Security Features

### Multi-Layer Security
- JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- HTTP-only cookies with CSRF protection
- Password encryption using bcrypt with salt
- Rate limiting for brute force protection
- Secure session management
- XSS protection through proper data sanitization

### Advanced Authentication Methods
- Email/Password authentication with strong validation
- Secure password reset flow
- Session management with automatic timeout
- Remember me functionality
- Secure logout with token invalidation

### Security Best Practices
- Input validation on both client and server
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Secure headers implementation
- Environment variable protection
- Database security with Prisma
- Comprehensive error handling

## Implemented Features

### Authentication
- User registration with validation
- Secure login with multiple security checks
- Logout functionality with token invalidation
- Route protection with middleware
- JWT token management with expiration
- Secure HTTP-only cookies

### Security
- Password encryption with bcrypt
- JWT tokens for authentication
- CSRF protection
- Data validation with Zod
- Secure cookie handling
- Rate limiting implementation

### Database
- PostgreSQL integration using Prisma
- Secure user model
- Automatic migrations
- Data encryption at rest
- Secure connection handling

### UI/UX
- Responsive forms
- Real-time validation
- Clear error messages
- Intuitive navigation
- Modern design with Tailwind CSS
- Security-focused user feedback

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for enhanced security
- **Prisma**: PostgreSQL ORM with type safety
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling and design
- **Zod**: Data validation
- **bcrypt**: Password encryption
- **Rate Limiter**: Protection against brute force attacks

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
JWT_SECRET="your-secure-secret"
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW="15m"
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS="100"
```

4. Run Prisma migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**:
   - User completes the form
   - Data validation on both client and server
   - Password strength verification
   - Password encryption with bcrypt
   - User creation in database
   - Redirect to login

2. **Login**:
   - Rate limiting check
   - Credential validation
   - JWT token generation
   - Secure cookie setting
   - Session creation
   - Redirect to dashboard

3. **Route Protection**:
   - Middleware token verification
   - Automatic redirection based on auth state
   - Protected route handling
   - Session validation

## Security Implementations

- **Token Security**:
  - JWT with expiration
  - Refresh token rotation
  - Token blacklisting

- **Password Security**:
  - Bcrypt hashing
  - Password strength requirements
  - Secure password reset flow

- **Session Security**:
  - HTTP-only cookies
  - CSRF protection
  - Session timeout
  - Secure session storage

- **API Security**:
  - Rate limiting
  - Input sanitization
  - Error handling
  - Request validation

## Future Improvements
