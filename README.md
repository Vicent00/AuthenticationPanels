# Basic Authentication Panel with Next.js

This project implements a basic authentication system using Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and JWT. It serves as a foundation for building more advanced security features and authentication panels in the future.

## Current Basic Features

### Authentication
- Basic user registration
- Simple login functionality
- Basic logout
- Route protection
- JWT token implementation
- Basic cookie handling

### Security
- Basic password encryption
- Simple JWT tokens
- Basic data validation
- Cookie security

### Database
- PostgreSQL with Prisma
- Basic user model
- Simple migrations

### UI/UX
- Clean forms
- Basic validation
- Error messages
- Simple navigation
- Modern design with Tailwind CSS

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14**: React framework
- **TypeScript**: Basic type safety
- **Prisma**: Database ORM
- **JWT**: Simple token authentication
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling
- **Zod**: Basic validation
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret"
```

4. Run Prisma migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
